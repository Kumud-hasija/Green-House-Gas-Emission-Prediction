# üåçGreenhouse Gas Emission Analysis & Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts greenhouse gas emissions from commodity and industry sources between 2010 and 2016. It combines multiple Excel sheets, cleans the data, visualizes emission trends, and trains a machine learning model to predict emissions using Random Forest.

## Overview

- Combines yearly commodity and industry data into a unified dataset
- Cleans and standardizes column names
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizes emissions over time for the top emitting entities
- Trains a Random Forest model to predict emissions based on features like year, type, and source
- Saves the trained model for future use

## Dataset

- Format: Excel sheets named `YYYY_Detail_Commodity` and `YYYY_Detail_Industry` for each year from 2010 to 2016
- Key columns:
  - `Name` ‚Äì Entity name (Commodity or Industry)
  - `Substance` ‚Äì Emission substance
  - `Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins` ‚Äì Target variable for ML
  - `Year`, `Source` ‚Äì Metadata
  - Various Data Quality (DQ) scores

All data is merged and processed into a single DataFrame for uniform analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Äì Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` ‚Äì Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` ‚Äì Machine learning
  - `joblib` ‚Äì Saving the model
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda recommended)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Make sure the Excel file (`green_house_gas_dataset.xlsx`) is present in the project folder.

3. Open and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Greenhouse_Gas_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Execute the cells in order:
   - Data loading
   - Preprocessing
   - EDA and visualization
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Model saving

## Output

- Summary statistics and trend plots
- Machine learning metrics: MSE and R¬≤ score
- Saved model: `emission_model.pkl`


## Program Information

**Program Name**: Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis & Prediction  
**Initiative**: Edunet Foundation ‚Äì Skills4Future (AICTE)


## LMS Submission Guidelines 

- **Week 1**:
    - We studied the dataset, understood its structure, and explored initial patterns.  
    - Cleaned and combined data from different sheets (commodity and industry) into one DataFrame for further analysis.
